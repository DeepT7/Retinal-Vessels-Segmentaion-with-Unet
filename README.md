In this project, I have trained a U-Net model to segment retinal vessels from RGB images. For ease of use, I also wrote a simple GUI so that users can use the trained model easily. 

You just need to run GUI.py to show up GUI and run cells in retinal-blood-vessel-segmentation-train.ipynb to train the U-Net model.
The following video will show you visually what I did:
